GearmanX-Starter

If you want to run tests on a live local gearman server, set
the environment variable GEARMAN_LIVE_TEST to "1".
Make sure a gearmand server process is started on the local
server (this test suite does not start gearmand). To start a gearman
server, enter (adjust path as appropriate):
/usr/local/sbin/gearmand -d

A worker will be created and functions will be registered.
The test will attempt to terminate the worker when finished
with the test suite.
