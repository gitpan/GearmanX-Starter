GearmanX-Starter

If you want to run tests on a live local gearman server, set
the environment variable GEARMAN_LIVE_TEST to "1",
A worker will be created and functions will be registered.
The test will attempt to terminate the worker, but if this
fails or doesn't run, then running the test suite
again will fail until the process is manually
terminated.
